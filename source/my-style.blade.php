                    I started making hardcore in 2018, and uptempo in 2019. Over the years a part of the uptempo scene has evolved in to the 'zaag' style.
                    At first, I didn't like it at all, but somehow I got hooked on the zaag addiction because of Invaderz. I have a best friend who absolutely hates zaag.
                    One day, just to mess with him, I messed around in my DAW with the goal of creating the most ridiculously heavy zaag track ever just to annoy him.
                    Enter the 'Jackhammer' track. What was supposed to be a joke turned out to be a serious contender in the zaag scene.
                    And thus, after producing multiple genres for about 9 years, I finally found MY STYLE!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do I best describe my style? Ridiculously hard & insanely wide reverse zaagkicks with abhorrent stretched heavy mid-bass kloenks that sound like someone being hit.... in the face... with an anvil...<br>
                    Basically, I'd like to pull out the entire set of sounds fresh out of the factory or the construction site to fill the drop.
                    As hard as I want the drop to be, I really like making the intro's and build-ups full of catchy original uplifting melodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beside that all, I definitely like to variate and experiment with different rhythms, tempo's and keys.
                    I want my tracks to sound refreshingly new & original, but also familiar at the same time, as paradoxical as it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are you a producer as well, just reading this? Wait... nobody reads this anyway. But f*ck it, just in case i ever blow up and you read this: I'm open to ideas, collab, perform, whatever.
